My Desktop Environment Setup
--------------------

My configuration and customization bits for WM/DEs I use.
Currently includes stuff for following setups:

 * [Sawfish](http://sawfish.wikia.com)
 * [Enlightenment E17](http://enlightenment.org)

It's not a tiling setup, because I prefer (and use) fullscreen windows on
"virtual desktops" anyway. And where I don't (floating skype, terminals), I just
bind a key to position the thing at some fixed location/size.

I don't use menu(s?) - either have a key to start what I need (on a constant
virtual desktop), use [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) to launch more
rare stuff or just run it from one of the terminals
([yeahconsole](http://phrat.de/yeahtools.html) on top, general xterm which I
always have open).

While sawfish is generally nice, I find it hard to debug and still struggling to
understand some things here, but that's mostly due to lack of effort.

Don't use any *dm. Used to (slim, qingy), but never really saw a point in them
when you can login into terminal just as well and type "exec startx" there.
It's not so easy to do on tablet though, where on-screen keyboard is only
available with X, so maybe I'll adopt one again in the near future.
