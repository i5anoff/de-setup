My Desktop Environment Setup
--------------------

My configuration and customization bits for WM/DEs I use.
Currently includes stuff for [Enlightenment E17](http://enlightenment.org).

It's not a tiling setup, because I prefer (and use) fullscreen windows on
"virtual desktops" anyway. And where I don't (floating skype, terminals), I just
bind a key to position the thing at some fixed location/size.

I don't use menu(s?) - either have a key to start what I need (on a constant
virtual desktop), use [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) to launch more
rare stuff or just run it from one of the terminals
([yeahconsole](http://phrat.de/yeahtools.html) on top, general xterm which I
always have open).

Don't have any *dm. Used to (slim, qingy), but never really saw a point in them
for a single-user system, where you can just start lock-screen or vt prompt (if
X isn't useful to have from the start for some reason).
